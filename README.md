# Antisemitism, Murder, and Manufactured Crises
## written by Richard Pham 
An opinion piece on antisemitism, murder, and manufactured crises. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sunday, 12/14/2025, mass shooting on Australia's Bondi Beach killed 15 Jewish people, and also managed to 
become a front-page story for today, the 15th. I want to briefly talk about some themes related to this antisemitic 
event, such as murder. Rob Reiner, of Jewish descent, and his wife were also murdered on the 14th. These are 
newsworthy events, and certainly spell of underlying problems plaguing Western societies, even those in the 
New World (the United States, Australia, etc) that do not carry the same scourge of colonial, feudalist, and 
miserly attitudes that so characterize Western Europe from the middle ages to today. 

Security failures, such as those that enabled the killing of public figure Charlie Kirk, were responsible for 
these early deaths. The biggest features of security failures, in my perspective, are a short list of three. 
The first one is of financial problems, uncertainty of worth and compensation, disparity of compensation 
and social standing, and predatory slaverous debt systems. I say this for the unofficial context: the United 
States has become very very guilty of facilitating financial problems, domestically and globally. Officially, 
however, I attempt not to inject moralism into why this facilitation occurs. And this is not necessarily 
because I have never received the short end of the stick in business matters, and most definitely not because 
I have never been discriminated against, for I know for a fact that if it is not my appearance and ethnicity, 
then it would be about my character and overall status that someone that hates me would latch onto, as fuel 
for their moralistic attacks against me. Just as an American slaver had to still own slaves during the waning 
days of legal African-American slavery before the outbreak of the American Civil War, any properly motivated 
hater will find loopholes to secure their position to assault their target, and will resort to all kinds of 
lies and fabrications, even when they are limited to civil non-violent politics, to assault their target. 
The trade wars the United States started during the first DJT administration (2016) is sufficient evidence 
enough to prove the claim that the United States continues to play roles of facilitating financial problems. 
Every nation is guilty of facilitating financial problems, some common ways being enabling financial fraud 
on a large scale (a weakness of the free market) and state-controlled wealth allocation (socialism, communism). 
But the United States, as a nation yearning to continue its role as a dominant global player, certainly cannot 
afford for so many people believing in the idea that it is a financial predator of a nation, and an unreliable 
one at that with gigantic national debt to countries as far away as across the Pacific Ocean. The United States 
is, in fact, silently and slowly ceding its role in affairs across Asia, due in no small part to having enabled 
a lopsided trade imbalance that made China into what it is today, a nation that went from being portrayed by 
American representatives as a profitable trading partner into one of adversarial and menacing nature to 
American hegemony. Such is the natural course of unequal exchanges and continual competition, as with the 
historical case of Japan in its post-WW2 stage of becoming a domineering electronics producer, an accomplishment 
that evoked a similar kind of fear and loathing from the American capitalist owner class. 

Financial problems may not seem to be much, but they are indeed telltale indicators of how great a nation 
has it under civilization of law and order. Sure, if there is not mass protesting, mass violence, mass discrimination, 
then what difference does it make for a peer to be paid twice as much or for an insurance company to charge 
a 200% increase in premium based on what they officially say is for legal reasons, but really entirely about 
helping to impoverish some of their clients? Financial problems exacerbate competition that usually far exceed 
legal and social frameworks put forth by government institutions. This excess encourages robbery, fraud, and 
media means of manipulation if not also outright hatred of "the elites", "the rich". Financial problems are why 
good friends end up turning their backs on each other, protecting their own necks and spilling others' secrets for 
an extra dime to their dollar (very convenient in information commercialism), since financial division already is 
an impediment to maintaining fair and honest relations with other human beings. 

Financial problems in nations such as the United States are not entirely the fault of Jewish people. This claim is 
perhaps the most aggravating commonality shared between some political groups. There are these financial security 
and compensation problems, right. And there are these diverse players in these financial games that obviously are 
looking out for their number ones, themselves. But attempting to discuss how to enact more fair compensation either 
does not happen due to "free market protections", or they do happen but the course of discussion turns very 
anti-intellectual and quick to point to entire groups as the cause of problems. Jews get made out to be the cause 
of financial woes, although their history in Western Europe since the Middle Ages certainly demonstrates their 
financial prowess as a minority group that managed to thrive under restrictive conditions, conditions that alternatively 
encouraged racial discrimination on other magnitudes such as African-American slavery and Japanese concentration camps 
in post-medieval timespans. There is a kind of madness produced by financial problems that cannot be resolved by stellar 
and accurate mathematics. That is because many numbers are forged, or the numbers may be entirely arbitrary, so far as 
imaginary. So attempting to backtrack to correct the math turns out to be a task of rewriting histories, thus risking 
the breakage of objectives such as economic stability and political representation. The United States has entered into 
a new era of economic warfare, as relayed by the press on matters especially revolving around Russian and Chinese 
spheres of influence. Many people have been getting squeezed. Anger and hate is encouraged by certain underground 
channels, clearly for dramatic dissatisfaction. Laissez Faire aims to continue the division between profits and losses, 
thus making matters convenient for outrageous predators to propagate claims over entire demographics before their 
campaigns, clearly for partial interests. To summarize on what financial problems produce for society, these 
problems increase security vulnerabilities. Weaknesses become exposed and predators get unleashed. And sadly, sometimes 
the official numbers of security apparatus are still there, but those weaknesses nevertheless still get exposed and 
predators still get enabled. Financial motive cannot be ruled out for security failures, whether those failures inconvenience 
elites or the poor alike. 

Related to the theme of financial problems is that of populist and mob organizations. The term "populist" is historically 
looked down on by elite classes across the world, not just in the United States. To be a populist is something like being 
a common person that has a worldview that their views are for the common people, yet a political representative with a 
name and institutional backing to their self cannot possibly be entirely common, so they cannot fully represent populist interests. 
In certain circles of elitism, calling someone a populist is similar to calling them a n*****. These principles explain 
why the American Democratic Party, a party with a historically elitist edge that has attempted to reform its image to appeal 
to the populace, has had many embarrassing failures since the ascent of DJT. And the American Democratic Party continues to 
spread its power too thin to tackle certain issues that the Republican Party never promised to its constituents that it would 
resolve. It was a matter of claiming and maintaining control that bested the promising of impossibilities. 

Populist organizations operate on mob-based mentalities. Information is desired to be controlled, and knowledge is desired 
to be streamlined into identical belief systems. These facts are certainly disputable due to kinds of misconception much of 
human reasoning revolves around. Populist organizations are not entirely confined to the right wing. Mob organizations do not 
have to be of and for the left wing. The attribute shared by populist and mob organizations is the aspect of anti-individualism, 
no matter the original cause that is usually much more noble than the chains of events proceeding it. Populist organizations 
may start off with the stated goal of reclaiming sovereignty, renewing liberties, and purifying collective identity from 
malfeasant outlier identities. But they usually emerge out of institutional failures, and this emergence carries with it 
forms of anarchy that cannot be trusted to fizzle down once any mission is accomplished. Due to the need to maintain unity 
through singular collective bonding, populism is filled with inconsistencies that liberalism would have simply shrugged off 
as part of liberal "not my problem, pal" profiteering. Yet, populism has an appeal to it. The appeal is de-alienation of 
common persons, re-unification of lands fragmented by territorial lines, perhaps even reformation, although reclaimation is 
the more likely path chosen simply due to material gains from kleptocratic campaigning. But in most cases, there is little 
chance for new and greater beginnings when entire branches are hacked off instead of alternatively channeled into 
other concentrations. Populist and mob organizations, alike, need representatives for the face of the power they exert behind 
that face. In theory of machines, agency shifts, agents sometimes change roles and sometimes get deposed, and these theoretical 
changes are valid because real-world examples can trace their principles back to these machine theoretics. Human identity, to a 
person, is as fragile as how open their mind is and how much their heart of whims and constants can accept before repelling the 
other. Collectivist organizations depend on shared cause, and modern mechanisms of channeling information for purposes of 
social engineering are stochastic at best, volatile to the detriment of specific people at worst. 

The last feature of security failures is that of information warfare. The leaking of sensitive information, for the purpose of 
enabling security vulnerabilities and/or commercial exploitation, can put targeted persons into harm's way. Fabrication of 
information can roil entire demographics to take impactful action. And when reflection occurs that proves the information acted 
on was fabricated, there is a strong tendency towards cover-ups, something very common in communist countries but not unique or 
that perfected by them. The developed world has went from embracing neo-liberal policies to pretending those same policies still 
apply, past their expiration date set by geopolitical rearrangements, to fizzling down into disorganization and silence as 
organized populist movements try to evolve themselves from aggressive underdogs to reigning kingpins. Communication, representation, 
and negotiation are the defaults in civil settings, and these categories of activities are at risk for weaponization into 
judgmental actions, via official processes and extremist initiative. Before embarking on drastic and deliberate campaigns, the 
mind must have been already made up, despite how much and how deep of thought said mind must have gone through to reach that 
decision. 

I did not include the arms industry or martial science in this list of three features of security failures, although their 
material values have tilted the axis of power towards certain countries over others from time to time. That is because I 
believe security failures are a matter of human intent: premeditation, deliberation, and execution. When the means is an 
instrument produced by scientific prowess, the instrument may be impressive but the user is the subject of possible questioning 
for their actions. 

I felt this discussion of security failures, in ways general but not entirely wholesome, is appropriate in relating to the 
antisemitic Bondi Beach event and other events with murder involved. Some decisions are taken on a personal basis. Some 
decisions are entirely irrational. So the three features I mentioned on security failures (financial problems, populist and 
mob organizations, and information warfare) are insufficient for revelation on these matters. But my brief descriptions of 
them contain some of my observations on occurring trends, trends that may relate to historical precedent. 

Crises are inevitable. But adequate defense through organization and commitment can downsize these crises. For example, the 
COVID-19 pandemic was cause for the US federal administration to declare a national emergency of lockdowns. Sadly but 
necessarily, these lockdowns then paved the way for a renewed and re-assertive American stance of containment policies, 
specifically those against Russian and Chinese spheres of influence. Containment policies are a kind of segregation, if one 
is to be truthful. Individuals have to fight against bad classification, based on sinister motives. Crises derail people 
from what they could have become by doing the things they could have done. But that is the concept of destiny for you, 
where one door closes and another opens. Manufacturing of crises relies on free market manipulation. Excesses are enabled 
in the name of freedom and then denounced as problems. Crises that have already been resolved through sufficient protocols 
are then placed into zones of human debate, zones that are sometimes driven by self-serving interests and almost always 
staffed by propagandists who dedicated much of their professional lives to the art of persuasion. This is what manufactured 
crises are, not the crises that occurred or are occurring, but the ways of acting on those crises (depiction, reaction) for 
motives indisputably slanted. Crises weaken security protocols to encourage security failures. Security failures are a kind 
of crises in and of themselves. And it is important to note that problems have combinative power to them. Combining problems 
is not so much an operation of addition but an operation of mutation, sometimes exponential from what those problems were 
originally worth.
